# PORTUNO

The PORTUNO project was developed as part of the Integrated Project I course in the Systems and Digital Media program at UFC (Federal University of Cear√°). The objective of the project was to create a digital solution to optimize room occupancy in the SMD (Systems and Digital Media) block. The project aimed to replace the current analog system of key borrowing with a digital innovation that would not only streamline the work of the course secretaries, Allan and Monalisa but also improve the efficiency of the borrowing process, enhance security, and promote the utilization of the block's spaces for learning purposes. The project consists of an application that allows students and professors to easily reserve rooms, as well as a reservation management system that provides the secretaries with greater control over the processes.

## Overview

PORTUNO is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) designed to streamline the process of room reservations and improve the management of room occupancy. The system offers the following features:

- Room Reservation: Students and professors can use the application to reserve rooms for specific time slots, facilitating their scheduling needs.
- Key Borrowing: The system includes a digital key borrowing mechanism, eliminating the need for physical key exchanges and providing enhanced security.
- Reservation Management: The secretaries, Allan and Monalisa, have access to a reservation management system that allows them to view, edit, and approve room reservations. This system provides them with greater control over the room occupancy and enables efficient management of the borrowing process.
- Notifications: The application sends automated notifications to users to remind them of their upcoming reservations and return deadlines for borrowed keys.

The PORTUNO project aims to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of room occupancy management, reducing administrative burden and enhancing user experience for both students and professors.
